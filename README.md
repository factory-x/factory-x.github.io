# Getting Started

## Preparing your development environment

Step 1: 

Install node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (Choose the LTS version)

Step 2:

Install yarn (wrapper around npm for faster package installs):
```shell
npm install -g yarn
```
Step 3:

Install factory-x-cli (Command Line Interface)

Use npm because the yarn install is not working yet for this package
```shell
npm install -g factory-x-cli
```

Step 4:

Install Github Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/

(Or use the git cli tools if you're comfortable)

Also apply for a free account if you don't have one yet and log in


Step 5:

Configure word to avoid pop-up when opening documents with html-code:

File > Options > Advanced > General > disable 'Confirm file format conversion on open'
